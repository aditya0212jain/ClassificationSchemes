# Classification Schemes
Classification methods implemented in python 3

for kNN algorithms the following distances can be used:
EuclideanDistance(x, xi) = sqrt( sum( (xj â€“ xij)^2 ) )

Other popular distance measures include:

Hamming Distance: Calculate the distance between binary vectors (more).
Manhattan Distance: Calculate the distance between real vectors using the sum of their absolute difference. Also called City Block Distance (more).
Minkowski Distance: Generalization of Euclidean and Manhattan distance
